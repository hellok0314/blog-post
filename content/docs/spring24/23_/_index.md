# Beyond Language Models: Byte Models are Digital World Simulators 

The basic unit of the digital world is the byte. All forms of information and operations are encoded and manipulated in binary format. Byte models simulate the digital world in a manner similar to predicting the next token in natural language processing by predicting the next byte. Models that utilize next byte prediction can directly learn from vast binary data and effectively simulate complex patterns in the digital world.

## Language Model (LM)

Language models segment text into small units (tokenization) and learn the structure and meaning of text by predicting the next token based on these tokens. These models have evolved from early LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based models to Transformer-based models.

Transformer models, particularly the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, enable effective language understanding and generation by pre-training on large-scale text data. These models can also be extended to other types of data, enhancing the versatility and general applicability of language models:

- **Audio Processing**: AudioPaLM, MusicGen
- **Image Processing**: iGPT
- **Biochemical Sequence**: Tranception, ProtGPT2, HyenaDNA

The ability to predict the next token has greatly empowered language models (LMs).

## Byte Model 

By extending language model (LM) techniques to predict the next byte in binary data, we can further enhance diversity in digital information processing and simulation of the digital world. Binary models expand traditional language models to the byte level, starting from the premise that all digital data and operations are fundamentally byte-based. These models process data from various modalities such as text, audio, and images uniformly as bytes, increasing their applicability in a wide digital environment.

Binary models have the following key features and benefits:

- **Learning Internal Patterns of Digital Systems**: Byte models can learn the internal operational patterns of digital systems. For example, they can be used to model and predict the workings of computer hardware or the processing sequences of software algorithms, which is useful for diagnosing or simulating digital systems.
- **Integrated Modeling Approach**: Byte models treat all data as byte sequences for processing. This approach integrates various data sources into a single framework, simplifying the modeling process and enhancing efficiency.

Specific applications of binary models include malware detection, program analysis, data conversion, and CPU state modeling. For instance, models like MalConv and DeepVSA analyze raw byte sequences of executable files to detect malware or perform memory analysis of programs. Additionally, byte sequences are used to process musical data such as MIDI files or to predict the state of a CPU after executing commands.

# Exploring bGPT 

bGPT is designed to model digital data at the byte level and is optimized to effectively process byte sequences. It has demonstrated performance comparable to specialized models across various modalities, including text, audio, and images, and offers new possibilities for predicting, simulating, and diagnosing hardware operations. Designed to predict and understand bytes, bGPT provides a deeper understanding of and interaction with digital systems.

## Architecture 

Learning patterns in digital systems at the byte level provides a unified approach to integrating various data types, but the high resolution of bytes results in long sequences that significantly increase computational costs. This issue is especially pronounced in transformer-based models, limiting the efficiency and scalability of processing binary data.

bGPT is equipped with a hierarchical structure designed to efficiently handle entire byte sequences. This structure segments a sequence of byte \( B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_T\} \) of length \( T \) into a sequence of patches \( P \), where each patch contains exactly \( S \) bytes:

\[ P = [P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N] \]

where \( N = \left\lceil \frac{T}{S} \right\rceil \) is the number of patches,

\[ P_i = [b_{(i-1)S+1}, \ldots, b_iS] \]

for \( 1 \leq i \leq N \). If \( T \mod S \neq 0 \),

\[ P_N = [b_{(N-1)S+1}, \ldots, b_T, e, \ldots, e] \]

where \( e \) represents the `<eop>` (end-of-patch).

The key components of the bGPT model are as follows:

- **Linear Projection Layer**: Each byte patch is mapped to a high-dimensional feature space through a linear projection layer. During this process, each byte is encoded into a 257-dimensional vector, which includes the 256 possible byte values and a special `<eop>` (end-of-patch) token.
- **Patch-Level Decoder**: The embedded patches are processed by a patch-level decoder. This decoder plays a role in predicting the features of the next patch from the embedding of each patch, thereby learning the structural patterns of the entire dataset.
- **Byte-Level Decoder**: Based on the predicted patch features, the byte sequence within each patch is reconstructed. The byte-level decoder uses the features of each patch to predict the next byte within that patch, processing the detailed information of the entire byte sequence.

## Model Training 

It is primarily trained through generative modeling, which revolves around the task of predicting the next byte. The main purpose of generative modeling is to learn the sequential dependencies of data, thereby developing the ability to predict the next byte in a given byte sequence.

### Generative Modeling 

This approach requires the model to predict the next byte in a given byte sequence. The model takes the byte sequence \( B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_T\} \) as input and utilizes all previous byte information to predict the next byte \( b_{i+1} \) at each position.

As a loss function, the negative log likelihood of the next byte at each step is minimized. This encourages the model to maximize the likelihood of the actual occurrence of the next byte.

\[ L_{\text{GEN}}(\theta) = -\sum_{i=1}^{T-1} \log p(b_{i+1} \mid b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_i; \theta) \]

### Classification 

Based on the knowledge acquired through generative modeling, bGPT can also be applied to classification tasks for labeled datasets. In this process, the model takes a byte sequence as input and predicts the category to which that sequence belongs.

For classification tasks, the loss function used is the cross-entropy loss, which ensures that the model accurately outputs the prediction probabilities for each category.

\[ L_{\text{CLF}}(\theta) = -\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_k \log p(y_k \mid B; \theta) \]

These training objectives enable bGPT to understand various byte-based data and accurately mimic digital patterns of the real world. The combination of generative approaches and classification capabilities grants the model the flexibility to tackle a diverse range of problems. Through this, the model can go beyond simple pattern recognition to play a crucial role in predicting and analyzing the operations of complex digital systems.

## Applications and Experiment 

This model enables the processing of various digital media files and the simulation of algorithms and hardware based on its capability to handle data at the byte level. The primary application areas include digital media processing and the simulation of algorithms and hardware.

### Digital Media Processing

bGPT is used for processing various types of digital media data such as text, audio, and images. This model performs learning targeted at media files through generative modeling, transforming the data into features and subsequently performing classification tasks based on these features.

For example, audio files are converted to and processed in WAV format, while images are processed at a low resolution in BMP format. By utilizing these standardized datasets, bGPT can develop a generalized understanding of various media types.
